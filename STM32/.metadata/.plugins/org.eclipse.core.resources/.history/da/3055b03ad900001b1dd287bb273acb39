/*
 * SPI master (STM) and SPI slave (Arduino) command and response based communication.
 * When button is pressed on the master side, master should send a command to the slave (Arduino) connected.
 * and slave responds as per the command implementation
 * 1. use SPI full duplex communication
 * 2. ST as Master and Arduino as Slave
 * 3. use dff = 0
 * 4. Use Hardware Slave Management
 * 5. SCLK = 2Mhz, fclk = 16Mhz
